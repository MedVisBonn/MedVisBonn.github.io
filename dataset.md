### Zenodo Link
You can find the download link for our SICS-155 dataset here: [Dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15044589).\
**Take Note**⚠️: Don't forget to [register](registration.md) before downloading the dataset.

### Details 
Currently only the **training** and **validation** subsets are published. After the challenge is finished, we will also release the remaining videos in the **test** set. The 3 sets were stratified by video duration so that an similiar number of short, medium and long videos are contained in each. 

The provided **ground truth** files are text (txt) files where each line corresponds to a video frame and contains the class label. You can find numeric indecies for each class-label in the mapping.txt file that is also provided.
