## Challenge abstract

Cataract is the leading cause of blindness worldwide, most affecting life in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The mainly used, most appropriate, and most cost-effective cataract surgical technique for LMICs is small incision cataract surgery (SICS). While algorithms have been developed for automated video analysis of surgical performance parameters for the cataract surgical technique predominantly used in high-income settings, so far there were no datasets nor algorithms for SICS available [^1] [^2] [^3]. This MICCAI challenge introduces the first SICS video dataset and offers teams the opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of their phase recognition algorithms. The dataset of 155 patients was recruited at Sankara Eye Hospital in India.

Analysis of surgical phases is important because it allows for quantitative comparison between different surgeons, feedback on identified critical steps, and detection of discrepancies from surgical protocols and because it is the first step for automatic assessment of surgical quality (Sim-OSSCAR) [^4]. Our contribution is the first public dataset for SICS holding surgical videos and phase annotations of 155 surgeries with 18 distinct phases.

Currently, there are other public cataract surgery phase datasets like Cataract-101 (n=101 videos) or the IEEE Cataracts (n=50 videos) but they only show phacoemulsification surgery which is distinct from SICS in the
following ways: SICS involves a larger 6-8 mm incision (2-3 mm for phaco), allowing for easier maneuvering of tools. The surgical phases in SICS are distinct, with steps such as Nucleus Delivery, Nucleus Prolapse, and
peritomy not performed in phacoemulsification, which instead includes Trenching, Nucleus Emulsification, and Irrigation/Aspiration [^5]. MSICS also utilizes specialized tools such as the Vectis, Dialer, Conjunctival Scissors,
Simcoe Cannula, Cautery, and Crescent Blade, which are not used in phaco; conversely, phacoemulsification surgery uses tools like Phaco Probe, Irrigation/Aspiration Probe, and Lens Injector [^6]. Still there is some overlap
between SICS and phacoemulsification and teams could consider using the mentioned datasets for transfer learning strategies.

Despite SICS widespread adoption in countries of the global south, no publicly available dataset exists for for this surgery, leaving a critical gap in cataract surgery research. Competitors are expected to submit an algorithm for predicting surgical phases based on the video data we supply and a short paper describing their approach.

The complete protocl can found here: [Protocol](https://zenodo.org/records/15087692).

We recently published a paper in Scientific Reports that establishs a performance baseline on a subset of the data used for this challenge (n=105). Find out more [here](https://doi-org.mu.idm.oclc.org/10.1038/s41598-025-00303-z).

## Dataset Overview

- **Name**: Small Incision Cataract Surgery Video Collection
- **Short name**: SICS-155
- **Size**: 155 videos
- **Splits**: 100 videos (train), 15 videos (validation), 40 videos (test)
- **Download**: [Link to dataset](dataset.md)
- **Details**: The 155 videos with a resolution of 960 x 540 pixels and a framerate of 30 FPS display small-incision cataract surgeries. Durations range from 5:01 to 21:58 minutes, and the average video length is 13:05 minutes. 
- **Ground truth**: The ground truth is provided in two formats, tabular and text files providing frame-by-frame phase annotations. In the the Excel file, start and end times of each observable phase in a video are defined.

## SICS Phases
The algorithm should target the prediction of surgical phases in the provided videos. For each frame in the
recordings, 1 of the 18 phases of SICS should be assigned by the algorithm. When no phase can be recognized in a
frame, a "background" phase can be assigned. A target frame rate of 15 frames per second (FPS) should be
achieved (lower than in the original videos to speed-up processing).
- peritomy: Conjunctiva is dissected to expose the sclera.
- cautery: Diathermy is applied to coagulate episcleral vessels.
- scleral_groove: A partial-thickness groove is made in the sclera.
- incision: The groove is extended to form a sclero-corneal tunnel.
- tunnel: A lamellar corneoscleral tunnel is dissected.
- sideport: A small incision for instrument access.
- AB_injection_and_wash: Balanced solution is injected to clear debris.
- OVD_injection: Viscoelastic is injected to maintain chamber stability.
- capsulorrhexis: A circular capsular opening is created.
- main_incision_entry: The tunnel is entered with a keratome.
- hydroprocedure: Fluid is injected to mobilize the nucleus.
- nucleus_prolapse: The nucleus is tilted into the anterior chamber.
- nucleus_delivery: The nucleus is removed via the scleral tunnel.
- cortical_wash: Residual cortex is aspirated.
- OVD_IOL_insertion: The intraocular lens is implanted into the capsular bag.
- OVD_wash: Remaining viscoelastic is removed.
- stromal_hydration: Incisions are hydrated for self-sealing.
- tunnel_suture: Bleeding is controlled with diathermy en suture.

| 31.08.2025 | Contacting the authors of top-ranked algorithms to prepare slides for oral presentation at MICCAI. |
| 01.09.2025 - 23.09.2025 | Final ranking of the results on unseen testing data. |

## Evaluation approach

For each submitted algorithm we will calculate the following metrics:
1. Accuracy (frame-wise)
2. Edit distance [also known as Levenshtein Distance] (phase-wise)
3. F1-score (frame-wise)
4. Precision-Recall area under curve (PR AUC)

Afterwards we will calculate a point-based significance ranking to establish the challenge winner, using the approach outlind in the recommed best practices by Maier-Hein et al [^7].
