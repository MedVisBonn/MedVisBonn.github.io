The participating teams are expected to upload a final docker container on our privately hosted CodaBench Instance that can be used to evaluate their method on the test set. They can base their container on the [codalab-legacy:gpu310](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-dockers) container, that follow a certain [folder structure](https://github.com/codalab/codabench/wiki/Submission-Docker-Container-Layout).
